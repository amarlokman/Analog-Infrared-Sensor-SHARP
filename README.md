# Analog-Infrared-Sensor-SHARP
There are some infrared distance sensors from the manufacturer Sharp, which can be operated very simply with the Raspberry Pi. There are different distance meters, which cover different distance ranges. These modules work similarly to laser distance meters, but with infrared light. There, bundled light is emitted by a transmitter and an analogue voltage is transmitted through a receiver on the basis of the angle of incidence, whereby the distance can be calculated.

Measuring the distance by using analog infrared sensor with SHARP brand. Two types of infrared sensor is being used which are Sharp GP2Y0A710K0F which can measure from 100cm to 550cm and  Sharp GP2Y0A02YK0F which can measure from 20cm to 150cm. This sensor will be used with the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+. Language involves is Python language.
